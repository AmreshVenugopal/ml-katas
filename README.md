# ml-katas

Katas for Machine Learning.

## Template for new kata

Pick a topic, create an _exercise_ using the following suggested template
(subject to change):

```
1. what do you want to learn at the end of this exercise?
2. how is your environment going to look like
  - datasets you are working with
  - tools, languages etc
3. reference documents, papers
```

Work on the solution and keep pushing in a this repo.
