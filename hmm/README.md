# Hidden Markov Model

## What goes here?

Implementation of HMM covering

- HMM specification and likelihood calculation
- HMM decoding
- Parameter estimation

For supervised (with provided hidden states) and unsupervised sequence
modelling.

## Environment

A dataset for supervised modelling can be
[UD_English](https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_English-EWT), which has
POS tags.
